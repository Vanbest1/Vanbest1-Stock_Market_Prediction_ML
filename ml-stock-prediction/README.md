# Machine Learning-Based Stock Market Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based stock market prediction system. The system utilizes various machine learning models to predict stock prices based on historical data and technical indicators. 

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains datasets used for training and testing the models.
  - **README.md**: Overview of the data directory and descriptions of the datasets.

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
  - **exploratory_analysis.ipynb**: Code for initial data exploration, including loading data, checking for missing values, and visualizing trends.

- **src/**: Source code for data processing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
  - **data_preprocessing.py**: Functions for data cleaning and preparation.
  - **feature_engineering.py**: Functions for creating features and technical indicators.
  - **model_training.py**: Implementation of model training and hyperparameter tuning.
  - **model_evaluation.py**: Functions for evaluating model performance and generating visualizations.
  - **prediction.py**: Functions for loading models and generating predictions.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists required libraries for the project.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by version control.

- **README.md**: Overview of the project, setup instructions, and key findings.

- **roadmap.md**: Comprehensive coding roadmap detailing each phase from setup to final results.
